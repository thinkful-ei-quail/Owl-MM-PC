# Project Brief

You should work one section at a time, creating components and writing smoke and snapshot tests. The components don't need to be interactive, but they do need to work with the provided data, rather than hard-coding every single DOM element. Don't worry about getting pixel-perfect styling, but try to retain something of the look and feel of the original elements.

## Section 1: The participant list

The participant list shows all of the current, or former, participants in the session. For each participant, you should show their name, avatar, and whether they are currently in the session. Participants who are in the session should be shown before participants who have left.

## Section 2: The stage

The stage shows the names, and avatars of everyone who is on the stage. We'll ignore the video element at the moment, and imagine that everyone has their camera turned off. Try to recreate the tiling behavior as participants join and leave using your Flexbox skills.

## Component 3: The chat log

The chat log should show a list of chat messages and other events (thumbs up, joining, leaving, etc.) which take place during the session. Each item should show when the event took place, and who carried it out.
